8.3_MM,"The appealing property of a spanning tree formed from a network/graph is the fact that all nodes are MINIMALLY CONNECTED (i.e. no loops are included). If the connections were also selected in such a way that the most favourable edge weights were used for building the tree (i.e. shortest path), the then so-called minimal spanning tree even represents the optimal connection of all other nodes. This means that the IS are not unnecessarily charged with messages during a Broad-/Multicast.  In order that all IS know the multicast trees, the LINK STATE PACKAGES CAN BE EXTENDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MULTICAST GROUPS. The row with destination and distance is expanded by the column indicating the multicast group membership of the destination. Since these packages are distributed to all nodes by broadcast, the IS can calculate the multicast tree for a certain multicast group independently once it has the information completely available locally to determine the outgoing lines for sending/forwarding the packages.",CORRECT,1.0,"[0.6218189001083374, 0.9112269282341003]","[(0, 43), (139, 164)]","[['Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: add multicast group information to the link state packet full network topology and group information locally The appealing property of a spanning tree formed from', 'necessarily charged with messages during a Broad-/Multicast.

Since the waiting time for the calculation of the shortest path is included in the weighting, connection EI now appears more attractive. New routing tables are created and the traffic then runs over connection EI, which is now heavily loaded. In the next step, connection CF appears more attractive again due to the smaller load, and so on. There follows a permanent change between the connections CF and EI, which is bad.

In Reverse Path Forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted.

Every receiving node has to ""ask itself the question"": Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? If the answer is YES, it will assume that the received packets used the BEST route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to ""ask itself"" two questions. First ""has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded. Otherwise it will ""ask itself"" the next question. ""Have the packets used the BEST route until now?"" If the answer is YES the node will send the packets onto an edge.

As a consequence, IPv6 allows to support billion of end-systems due to larger address space (according to wikipedia 2^128 different ip addresses possible)  2. increase of security - the protocol IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) allows to achieve the security goals confidentiality, authenticity and integrity on the network level. For instance, this can prevent the manipulation of the IP source address or the content of the IP datagram (integrity protection). - IPSec is supported by IPv6 by default  3. simplify protocol processing - due to a simplified IP header in IPv6 the protocol processing becomes less complex for routers. In general one can say that the header of an IPv6 packet has less fields to process, e.g. the header checksum is removed (can be handled on layer 2 or layer 4).

10.1_TC,"UDP is a fast and simple, unreliable, connectionless, and message-oriented transport protocol. That has NO flow or error control. But may be used with broadcast/multicast and streaming. UDP is mostly IP with a short transport header. The UDP header format contains:  1. Sender port: an optional 16 bit sender identification. when used the response may be sent there, but when not used it will be (0000000000000000). 2. Receiver port: it is receiver identification and it's also 16 bit.  3. Packet length: it is in bytes (including UDP header). The minimum length is 8 (byte), i.e., header without data. 4. Checksum: of the header (not the packet) and data for error detection. Use of checksum optional.  TCP is a connection-oriented and reliable bidirectional in-order end-to-end byte stream (Socket: SOCK_STREAM) transport protocol. The connections in TCP established and torn down. There are multiplexing and demultiplexing ports at both ends. And TCP provides error control (Users see correct, ordered byte sequences), end-to-end flow control (Avoid overwhelming the machines at either end), and also provides congestion avoidance (Avoid creating traffic jams within the network). The TCP header format same as the UDP header format contains Source and Destination Ports (sender and receiver ports in UDP) which are 16 bit each, and it contains Checksum like the UDP. But it is more complicated than the UDP and it contains: 1. Sequence Number.  2. Acknowledgment Number (Ack. No.).  3. HL/RESV/Flags.  4. Advertised Window. 5. Urgent Pointer.  6.

12.2_PE,"From the problem we recognise that the number of packets arriving is lambda=9 pkts per second and number of packets being serviced is µ=10 pkts per second. Dividing the lambda by µ gives us the utilization. In the case of an equilibrium in a finite buffer, the probability of having less than 10 packets can be calculated from the formula of the blocking probability (slide 31).

5.12,"One method to resolve the problem of duplicate packets is to use temporarily valid TSAPs for only one connection. On paper, this reduces the problem of duplicates since each TSAP is only used once and therefore reduces the number of duplicates to the ones occuring in that one connection. However, a disadvantage is that some TSAPs always exist and are well-known. Hence, it is not possible to realize this approach and generate temporary TSAPs for each connection.   Another method would be to make connections unique and identify them individually. An advantage is that duplicates from different connections do not occur anymore since each is unique. However, this is not possible with connection-less systems. Additional knowledge is needed to realize this approach since end systems need to remember the sequence numbers even after being turned off so that they remain unique for each connection.   The third approach to solve duplicates is to identify each packet individually with unique sequence numbers. An advantage is that it easily allows the receiver to identify and discard duplicate packets since it can just compare sequence numbers to check if it already received a packet with that number. However, this approach requires that the range of sequence numbers are chosen wisely so that they do not repeat before each packet is delivered and processed.

Individual sending wastes bandwidth and requires the sender to know all destinations. Flooding may produce too many duplicates. Broadcast routing like Reverse Path Fowarding and Reverse Path Broadcast can be used to avoid such problems. Specifically, Reverse path broadcast can be used to avoid another problem of Reverse path forwarding, since it forwards packets over suitable edges instead of resend them over all edges. Both algorithms use spanning tree for router initiating broadcast, which is based on a subset of subnets including all routers with no loops. Upon arrival of a packet at an IS, both algorithms make the following decisions: Forwarding: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, the packet is resent over all edges excluding the incoming one. If not, the packet is discarded. Broadcast: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent, and if the packet used the best route until now, the edge is selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S, if not, the algorithm does not send over all edges, i.e., not as in Reverse path forwarding.

The algorithm is very robust, but there is lots of overhead because of the many potential duplicates in the network. With a spanning tree the number of packets, especially the duplicates, can be minimized/limited. In multicast, this spanning tree can then also be reduced to the nodes belonging to the group.  To get such a spanning tree different protocols as for example Distance Vector or Link State routing can be used. For Link State routing, every node sends the information of all his neighbor nodes to everyone. With this information, the nodes can reconstruct the whole network and use e.g. Dijkstra Algorithm to get a spanning tree. For Multicast, each node also sends the information in the packets to which group they belong, so there can be also determined a multicast path by every node.

They are all minimally connected. That means that the spanning tree will no longer be connected if one edge is eliminated. The spanning tree algorithm ensures that there are no undesirably rotating packets. It identifies multiple paths by converting topologies with redundant paths by logically blocking certain paths into a tree topology with no loops. All but one connection is blocked on the switches with multiple connections to other switches. To construct a spanning tree for multicasting out of a link-state routing, each IS knows which group it belongs to but doesn't know which other IS belongs to the group as well.

8.2_MM,"Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are routing algorithms that are used for multicast routing scenarios. To adjust to changing topologies they utilize flooding to find suitable routes. The principle of the Reverse Path Forwarding is that each station has a spanning tree that represents the routing to other stations. The packets are flooded from the first sending station and propagated through the network. When a packet is received, each station checks whether a packet arrived at the port it usually arrives at. If so it is assumed that it used the best path until now and the packet is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded.  The Reverse Path Broadcast follows a similar approach. It differs in how it handles packets that are received on the entry port packets to this destination are usually assumed at. There is an additional check, if the packet used the best route until now. If so the edge is selected at which unicast packets arrive and from which they are then rerouted to the source. Otherwise it is not sent over all edges.",PARTIAL_CORRECT,0.625,"[0.5881364345550537, 0.6774801015853882, 0.9566776752471924]","[(179, 192), (0, 31), (0, 31)]","[['.
