8.3_MM,"The appealing property of a spanning tree formed from a network/graph is the fact that all nodes are MINIMALLY CONNECTED (i.e. no loops are included). If the connections were also selected in such a way that the most favourable edge weights were used for building the tree (i.e. shortest path), the then so-called minimal spanning tree even represents the optimal connection of all other nodes. This means that the IS are not unnecessarily charged with messages during a Broad-/Multicast.  In order that all IS know the multicast trees, the LINK STATE PACKAGES CAN BE EXTENDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MULTICAST GROUPS. The row with destination and distance is expanded by the column indicating the multicast group membership of the destination. Since these packages are distributed to all nodes by broadcast, the IS can calculate the multicast tree for a certain multicast group independently once it has the information completely available locally to determine the outgoing lines for sending/forwarding the packages.",the LINK STATE PACKAGES CAN BE EXTENDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MULTICAST GROUPS,Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: add multicast group information to the link state packet full network topology and group information locally,CORRECT

8.2_MM,"The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory. In Reverse Path Forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. An accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. If packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies. Reverse Path Broadcasting makes use of the Reverse Path Forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. Every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not. If they are not on that best path they will not forward the packets to those nodes. By doing this the traffic in a network is restricted to less and less packets (fewer copies).",The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory.

Since the waiting time for the calculation of the shortest path is included in the weighting, connection EI now appears more attractive. New routing tables are created and the traffic then runs over connection EI, which is now heavily loaded. In the next step, connection CF appears more attractive again due to the smaller load, and so on. There follows a permanent change between the connections CF and EI, which is bad.

8.2_MM,"The purpose of RPF and RPB is to reduce redundancy, when broadcasting packets, on connection lines, which are not useful to the broadcasting process and try to create a spanning tree (without loops). In Reverse Path Forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted. They will rebroadcast the packets to their neighbours, only not back to the sender, until the packets reached every node. Every receiving node has to ""ask itself the question"": Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? If the answer is YES, it will assume that the received packets used the BEST route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to ""ask itself"" two questions. First ""has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded. Otherwise it will ""ask itself"" the next question. ""Have the packets used the BEST route until now?"" If the answer is YES the node will send the packets onto an edge.

Reverse Path Broadcast: When a packet is unicasted to a particular station the other other station listen to check if that is the best route to the packet forwarding for the receiver station or not. If that is the best route then when a packet arrives at a station then it is also send to this edge. If that is not the best route then the packet is rejected and not sent on that path.

11.2_SDN,"One such benefit would be the reduced switch complexity, since the control logic is removed from the switch and being hosted on servers. However, the same forwarding performance is preserved because the switches still support forwarding in hardware. The application and the network can be realized as one integrated system via SDN which enables a global view onto the system, therefor simplifying the implementation of control logic. Control plane distribution is required to ensure failure tolerance, but for keeping control logic implementations simple, the distribution needs to be transparent for them, what makes the implementation of the controller harder. Only two out of the three CAP properties - consistency, availability and partitioning tolerance - are possible. Depending on how often the switches are reconfigured, the traffic between the control nodes and switches may become relevant and even slow down the overall network traffic.

Thus a medium access procedure based on random access should be chosen. With random access and a high channel load also the problem for collision arises and handling of collision detection becomes necessary. I would recommend using CSMA/CD as it has (1) a low overhead and (2) utilizes the bandwith to its fullest when possible.

1.6,"Differential Manchester encoding should be used because it is overall more complex.   Similarly to Manchester encoding, DM encoding takes advantage of splitting the interval into two, where a voltage level shift takes place (either from high voltage to low voltage or vice versa). However, Manchester encoding is still too similar to binary encoding in that a 1 will always be equivalent to a voltage shift from high --> low and a 0 will always be low --> high voltage. Instead, if the voltage shift occurs between intervals (either high -> low or low -> high), a 0 will be encoded. Likewise, if there is no voltage shift between intervals then a 1 is encoded. By comparing the current interval to the previous interval's voltage level, a more accurate encoding technique can be realized.  And unlike the binary encoding system, DM encoding does not rely on binary voltage levels to encode a bit stream. Instead, merely a change in voltage level between intervals encodes the bit stream. (Ex. A lack of voltage level change between the first and second interval would mean that the second bit in the stream is a 1) Therefore, because the voltages only need to differ between intervals, the bit stream is less susceptible to noise/error.",Differential Manchester encoding should be used because it is overall more complex,as it is the most efficient in terms of bandwidth,INCORRECT

4.2_LM_v1.0,"Two solutions to the problem mentioned before are carrier extension and frame bursting. The basic principle in carrier extension is to attach a new extension field containing “scrap” data to the frame just to make it larger so that collisions can be detected. In Frame Bursting you take a similar approach, but instead of appending otherwise useless data, you just send a concatenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission. This is much more efficient than the carrier extension as no bandwidth is wasted on “scrap” data but the drawback is that the end-to-end delay for a frame is increased since you generally have to wait until you have the specified number of frames to send as a sequence which is bad for interactive services.",you just send a concatenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission,by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission,CORRECT

Therefore only if this is the case packets distributed over all edges. If the packet is received over another entry point it will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a refined version of this algorithm. It differs from Reverse Path Forwarding by the fact, that if the packets have taken the best route until their arrival at a certain node they will be forwarded to the best next edge taken from the routing table. If not, they are NOT sent over all edges.

Identification of individual       connections:             Each Connection is assigned to a SeqNo. Packages from earlier       connections can be detected by checking for the current SeqNo. Therefore       the end systems have to store the SeqNo for every connection (doesn't       work for connection-less data transfer). Identification of individual       PDUs:             Every PDU has a SeqNo that only gets reused after a long enough       time (no duplicates possible anymore).

8.3_MM,"In Broad/Multicast the goal is to reach the whole network or a group to share the resources as efficient as possible. For Broadcast, a simple algorithm like Flooding can be used. The algorithm is very robust, but there is lots of overhead because of the many potential duplicates in the network. With a spanning tree the number of packets, especially the duplicates, can be minimized/limited. In multicast, this spanning tree can then also be reduced to the nodes belonging to the group.  To get such a spanning tree different protocols as for example Distance Vector or Link State routing can be used. For Link State routing, every node sends the information of all his neighbor nodes to everyone. With this information, the nodes can reconstruct the whole network and use e.g. Dijkstra Algorithm to get a spanning tree. For Multicast, each node also sends the information in the packets to which group they belong, so there can be also determined a multicast path by every node. A multicast spanning tree is created.",each node also sends the information in the packets to which group they belong,Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: add multicast group information to the link state packet full network topology and group information locally,PARTIAL_CORRECT

8.3_MM,"An important property of spanning trees is that spanning trees do not have any cycles. Adding any edge to the tree will result in a cycle. So, a spanning tree is maximally acyclic. They are all minimally connected. That means that the spanning tree will no longer be connected if one edge is eliminated. The spanning tree algorithm ensures that there are no undesirably rotating packets. It identifies multiple paths by converting topologies with redundant paths by logically blocking certain paths into a tree topology with no loops. All but one connection is blocked on the switches with multiple connections to other switches. To construct a spanning tree for multicasting out of a link-state routing, each IS knows which group it belongs to but doesn't know which other IS belongs to the group as well. The IS sends packets that contain the distance to neighbors and the information on which multicast group it belongs to. The packet is sent by broadcast to all other nodes. Based on that, each IS calculates the multicast tree and determines the outgoing lines on which the packets have to be transmitted.",The IS sends packets that contain the distance to neighbors and the information on which multicast group it belongs to,Spanning Tree with Link State Routing: add multicast group information to the link state packet full network topology and group information locally,CORRECT
8.2_MM,"Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are routing algorithms that are used for multicast routing scenarios. To adjust to changing topologies they utilize flooding to find suitable routes. The principle of the Reverse Path Forwarding is that each station has a spanning tree that represents the routing to other stations. The packets are flooded from the first sending station and propagated through the network. When a packet is received, each station checks whether a packet arrived at the port it usually arrives at. If so it is assumed that it used the best path until now and the packet is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded.  The Reverse Path Broadcast follows a similar approach. It differs in how it handles packets that are received on the entry port packets to this destination are usually assumed at. There is an additional check, if the packet used the best route until now.
