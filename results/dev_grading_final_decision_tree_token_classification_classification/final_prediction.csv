8.3_MM,"The appealing property of a spanning tree formed from a network/graph is the fact that all nodes are MINIMALLY CONNECTED (i.e. no loops are included). If the connections were also selected in such a way that the most favourable edge weights were used for building the tree (i.e. shortest path), the then so-called minimal spanning tree even represents the optimal connection of all other nodes. This means that the IS are not unnecessarily charged with messages during a Broad-/Multicast.  In order that all IS know the multicast trees, the LINK STATE PACKAGES CAN BE EXTENDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MULTICAST GROUPS. The row with destination and distance is expanded by the column indicating the multicast group membership of the destination. Since these packages are distributed to all nodes by broadcast, the IS can calculate the multicast tree for a certain multicast group independently once it has the information completely available locally to determine the outgoing lines for sending/forwarding the packages.",CORRECT,1.0,"[0.6028032898902893, 0.6359648108482361]","[(139, 164), (180, 181), (184, 186), (214, 215), (227, 228), (232, 233)]","[['the LINK STATE PACKAGES CAN BE EXTENDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MULTICAST GROUPS', 'the', 'membership', 'cast', 'once', 'complete']]",PARTIAL_CORRECT

10.1_TC,"There are the differences between TCP and UDP headers: 1. TCP has a at least 20 bytes variable length header while UDP has an 8 bytes fixed length header. 2. TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms since it uses checksum but also provides flow control and acknowledgement of data while UDP has only basic error checking mechanisms using checksum. In TCP, Erroneous packets are retransmitted from the source to the destination. 3. TCP header contains the sequence number of data but UDP does not contain the sequence number. There is no sequencing of data in UDP. 4. TCP header has urgent pointer to show receiver where urgent data ends but UDP does not have this urgent pointer. 5. TCP contains information for not only compulsory but also optional functions while UDP has only the information for compulsory function. 6. UDP is comparatively faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP. However, TCP is reliable since it guarantees delivery of data to the destination. 7. TCP is heavy-weight, since TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control. However, UDP is lightweight.

8.2_MM,"The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory. In Reverse Path Forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. An accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. If packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies. Reverse Path Broadcasting makes use of the Reverse Path Forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. Every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not. If they are not on that best path they will not forward the packets to those nodes. By doing this the traffic in a network is restricted to less and less packets (fewer copies).",CORRECT,1.0,"[0.6091259717941284, 0.6729318499565125, 0.7382715344429016]","[(0, 62), (185, 240)]","[['The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory', 'Reverse Path Broadcasting makes use of the Reverse Path Forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes']]",PARTIAL_CORRECT

New routing tables are created and the traffic then runs over connection EI, which is now heavily loaded. In the next step, connection CF appears more attractive again due to the smaller load, and so on. There follows a permanent change between the connections CF and EI, which is bad.

8.2_MM,"The purpose of RPF and RPB is to reduce redundancy, when broadcasting packets, on connection lines, which are not useful to the broadcasting process and try to create a spanning tree (without loops). In Reverse Path Forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted. They will rebroadcast the packets to their neighbours, only not back to the sender, until the packets reached every node. Every receiving node has to ""ask itself the question"": Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? If the answer is YES, it will assume that the received packets used the BEST route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to ""ask itself"" two questions. First ""has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded.

For instance, this can prevent the manipulation of the IP source address or the content of the IP datagram (integrity protection). - IPSec is supported by IPv6 by default  3. simplify protocol processing - due to a simplified IP header in IPv6 the protocol processing becomes less complex for routers.

12.2_PE,"First of all we can derive all necessary values from the text: The buffer size is N=10, the arrival rate is ƛ = 9 and the service rate is μ = 10. As a next step, we can then calculate the change rate of the queue to ρ = ƛ/μ = 0.9. What we have to do next is to calculate the state probability for all states with less than 10 packets in the queue and sum those values up. We use the formula p_n = ((1-ρ)ρ^n)/(1-ρ^(N+1)) for each single state. The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492. In the last step, we have to combine this finding with the time of observation. Multiplying those values delivers us the expected length of a state with less than 10 packets in the queue: E(T | waiting packets less than 10) = 0.9492 * 60s = 56.952s.

5.12,"1.  to use temporarily valid TSAPsTo avoid duplicates we could use a unique TSAP for every connection. This is an easy way to distinguish between duplicates. In theory this would solve our problem but in practical real-world scenarios this is not possible because we have designated well-known TSAPs that do not change (e.g. HTTP -> port 80)  2. to identify connections individuallyThis method wants to get rid of duplicates between connections. In this method we assign each individual connection a new sequence number. Again in theory this is a simple solution that should work and we can use the well-known ports. One disadvantage of this is though that the endsystems have to remember the already assigned sequence numbers. So the endsystems have to store more information. Also another issue to mention is that this works only for connection oriented systems, this won't work with connection-less systems.   3. to identify PDUs individually: individual sequential numbers for each PDUTo go even one step further we could identify the individual packets. So each packet get a unique sequence number. This is a very good way of avoiding duplicates. But for this to work we have to make sure that we chose a sensible sequence number range (depending on the packet rate and lifetime).

11.2_SDN,"Benefits: [1] Traditional network infrastructure has limited flexibility. SDN controller helps and assists with easy modification of the network control logic - From “hard-coded” logic to exchangeable software. This would enable to program the network at a higher level - “Think of it as a general language or an instruction set that let’s me write a control program for the network rather than having to rewrite all of code on each individual router,” - Scott Shenker [2] It helps to reduce switching complexity by removing control logic from switch and host it on servers, and this happens while preserving same forwarding performance.  Drawbacks: [1] Since functionalities of Routers and Switches are provided through Controller, Controller can be vulnerable to security attacks, therefore added extra security features can be an overhead.

10.1_TC,"UDP is a fast and simple, unreliable, connectionless, and message-oriented transport protocol. That has NO flow or error control. But may be used with broadcast/multicast and streaming.

Sender port: an optional 16 bit sender identification. when used the response may be sent there, but when not used it will be (0000000000000000). 2. Receiver port: it is receiver identification and it's also 16 bit.  3. Packet length: it is in bytes (including UDP header). The minimum length is 8 (byte), i.e., header without data. 4. Checksum: of the header (not the packet) and data for error detection. Use of checksum optional.  TCP is a connection-oriented and reliable bidirectional in-order end-to-end byte stream (Socket: SOCK_STREAM) transport protocol. The connections in TCP established and torn down. There are multiplexing and demultiplexing ports at both ends. And TCP provides error control (Users see correct, ordered byte sequences), end-to-end flow control (Avoid overwhelming the machines at either end), and also provides congestion avoidance (Avoid creating traffic jams within the network). The TCP header format same as the UDP header format contains Source and Destination Ports (sender and receiver ports in UDP) which are 16 bit each, and it contains Checksum like the UDP.

1.6,"Differential Manchester encoding should be used because it is overall more complex.   Similarly to Manchester encoding, DM encoding takes advantage of splitting the interval into two, where a voltage level shift takes place (either from high voltage to low voltage or vice versa). However, Manchester encoding is still too similar to binary encoding in that a 1 will always be equivalent to a voltage shift from high --> low and a 0 will always be low --> high voltage. Instead, if the voltage shift occurs between intervals (either high -> low or low -> high), a 0 will be encoded. Likewise, if there is no voltage shift between intervals then a 1 is encoded. By comparing the current interval to the previous interval's voltage level, a more accurate encoding technique can be realized.  And unlike the binary encoding system, DM encoding does not rely on binary voltage levels to encode a bit stream. Instead, merely a change in voltage level between intervals encodes the bit stream. (Ex. A lack of voltage level change between the first and second interval would mean that the second bit in the stream is a 1) Therefore, because the voltages only need to differ between intervals, the bit stream is less susceptible to noise/error.",INCORRECT,0.0,"[0.8186060786247253, 0.588685929775238, 0.6255906224250793, 0.6385037302970886, 0.5221590399742126]","[(22, 24), (71, 72), (76, 77), (78, 79), (99, 100), (106, 107), (202, 211), (228, 229)]","[['encoding', 'encoding', 'to', 'binary', 'from', '0', 'And unlike the binary encoding system', 'en']]",CORRECT

2.4,"I would recommend CSMA p-persistent because it would the most efficient for large amounts of transmissions while also preventing collisions. It is more efficient than non-persistent (for example) due to the way it checks the channel for activity, rather than waiting a random amount of time to check back, the p-persistent procedure checks back continuously and then based on some probability p, starts transmitting. Although it only checks for collision after transmission, it has a much lower rate of transmitting when others are also transmitting due to the random nature at which begins its transmission. This prevents all 20 systems from immediately transmitting at once as soon as the channel is free.

5.12,"One method to resolve the problem of duplicate packets is to use temporarily valid TSAPs for only one connection. On paper, this reduces the problem of duplicates since each TSAP is only used once and therefore reduces the number of duplicates to the ones occuring in that one connection. However, a disadvantage is that some TSAPs always exist and are well-known. Hence, it is not possible to realize this approach and generate temporary TSAPs for each connection.   Another method would be to make connections unique and identify them individually. An advantage is that duplicates from different connections do not occur anymore since each is unique. However, this is not possible with connection-less systems. Additional knowledge is needed to realize this approach since end systems need to remember the sequence numbers even after being turned off so that they remain unique for each connection.   The third approach to solve duplicates is to identify each packet individually with unique sequence numbers.

Individual sending wastes bandwidth and requires the sender to know all destinations. Flooding may produce too many duplicates. Broadcast routing like Reverse Path Fowarding and Reverse Path Broadcast can be used to avoid such problems. Specifically, Reverse path broadcast can be used to avoid another problem of Reverse path forwarding, since it forwards packets over suitable edges instead of resend them over all edges. Both algorithms use spanning tree for router initiating broadcast, which is based on a subset of subnets including all routers with no loops. Upon arrival of a packet at an IS, both algorithms make the following decisions: Forwarding: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, the packet is resent over all edges excluding the incoming one. If not, the packet is discarded. Broadcast: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent, and if the packet used the best route until now, the edge is selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S, if not, the algorithm does not send over all edges, i.e., not as in Reverse path forwarding.

It starts to transmit 1 packet and if that packet is transmitted successfully and receives an ACK, it increases its window size to 2, and after receiving 2 ACKs it increases its window size to 4, and then 8, and so on.. ""slow start"" increases its window size exponentially until the slow-start threshold is reached.  Phase 2: Congestion Avoidance Afterwards, the congestion window is only incremented by one unit if all packets from the window have been successfully transmitted. It therefore only grows linearly per roundtrip time. This phase is called the Congestion Avoidance Phase.

The algorithm is very robust, but there is lots of overhead because of the many potential duplicates in the network. With a spanning tree the number of packets, especially the duplicates, can be minimized/limited. In multicast, this spanning tree can then also be reduced to the nodes belonging to the group.  To get such a spanning tree different protocols as for example Distance Vector or Link State routing can be used. For Link State routing, every node sends the information of all his neighbor nodes to everyone. With this information, the nodes can reconstruct the whole network and use e.g. Dijkstra Algorithm to get a spanning tree. For Multicast, each node also sends the information in the packets to which group they belong, so there can be also determined a multicast path by every node.

They are all minimally connected. That means that the spanning tree will no longer be connected if one edge is eliminated. The spanning tree algorithm ensures that there are no undesirably rotating packets. It identifies multiple paths by converting topologies with redundant paths by logically blocking certain paths into a tree topology with no loops. All but one connection is blocked on the switches with multiple connections to other switches. To construct a spanning tree for multicasting out of a link-state routing, each IS knows which group it belongs to but doesn't know which other IS belongs to the group as well.

To adjust to changing topologies they utilize flooding to find suitable routes. The principle of the Reverse Path Forwarding is that each station has a spanning tree that represents the routing to other stations. The packets are flooded from the first sending station and propagated through the network. When a packet is received, each station checks whether a packet arrived at the port it usually arrives at. If so it is assumed that it used the best path until now and the packet is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded.  The Reverse Path Broadcast follows a similar approach. It differs in how it handles packets that are received on the entry port packets to this destination are usually assumed at. There is an additional check, if the packet used the best route until now.

8.1_MM,"1. Hidden Terminals: In mobile routing we communicate wireless. Consider the setup from slide 11: A to B, C to B. In here, node A can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node C. Node C can communicate with the intermediate node B but not with node A. The hidden terminal problem occurs when node A and node B want to send data to node B at the same time. This results in collsions and waste of resources. The collision problem can be solved with Request-to-Send (RTS) and Clear-To-Send (CTS) mechanism. When node A wants to send something to node B, node A first asks whether the communication channel is available through RTS. If everything is ok, B sends a CTS message to A and C. As a consequence, node C knows that nothing can be sent to B for a certain amount of time. If node C wants to send something to B, C needs to reserve the channel too by a RTS. 2. Near and Far Terminals: - Consider the setup from slide 18: We have three nodes A, B and C. B and C are relatively close to each other while A has a larger physical distance to the other nodes. The problem of near and far terminals occurs when A and B want to send something to C at the same time.
