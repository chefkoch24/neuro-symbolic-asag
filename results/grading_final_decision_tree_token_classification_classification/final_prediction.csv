8.2_MM,"Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network. The idea of both algorithms is the use of so called “spanning trees” for each individual node in the network, which contain routes to every subnode in every subnetwork. Since one intermediary system does only know his own spanning tree, but not the ones of the surrounding nodes, each router has to use its knowledge of optimal routing for certain destinations as a criterion for further transmission. For Reverse Path Forwarding this means, that each node has to check the link on which an incoming packet is received. If this link is the optimal one, over which packets for this station are also usually sent, then node can assume that the packet has taken an optimal way up to it. As a consequence, it then re-sends the packet over all of its edges, but not the one on which the packet was received. If the packet on the other hand does not come over such an “optimal” link it gets discarded.  Since re-sending over all edges seems not to be the most efficient way of multicast-routing, Reverse Path Broadcast introduces a further check for packets that arrive over the optimal link as well as a limited re-transmission of packets: If a packet has taken the optimal path until this station, the station reroutes the packet over the optimal incoming link to the Source in reversed direction. This means, that the receiving node looks up in its routing table over which link such a packet would normally be received. Exactly this link is then used for rerouting the packet to the source instead of using all links as it is done before in Reverse Path Forwarding. Otherwise (so to say if the packet is not received on an optimal link or received on an optimal link, but has not taken an optimal path so far), the packet is not resent. This mechanism is implemented to limit the number of duplicates in the network - while Reverse Path Forwarding retransmits over all edges (excluding the one on which the packet was received), Reverse Path Broadcasting chooses the most suitable link for retransmission.",CORRECT,1.0,"[0.6493939161300659, 0.6780773997306824, 0.6709916591644287]","[(0, 27), (28, 37), (38, 39), (164, 175)]","[['Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi-', 'broadcast communication and therefore aim to', 'more', 'For Reverse Path Forwarding this means']]",CORRECT

MODE OF OPERATION: Both are based on the idea of the Spanning Tree to use the shortest possible paths from the sender to the receivers. _RPF_ FORWARDS A BROADCAST PACKET arriving on one link over all other links ONLY IF IT ARRIVES OVER A LINK OVER WHICH, according to its own routing table, PACKETS ARE ALSO ROUTED TO THE SENDER OF THE BROADCAST (i.e. it is assumed that the packet arrived on the best path), OTHERWISE THE PACKET IS DISCARDED. _RPB_ differs from _RPF_ in the way it forwards packets: A PACKET IS ONLY FORWARDED TO A DIRECT NEIGHBOURING NODE IF THE FORWARDING NODE WOULD ALSO BE LOCATED ON A UNICAST PATH BETWEEN THE SENDER AND THAT NEIGHBOURING NODE. For example, if a node B receives a broadcast packet from A and B has links with C and D, but has previously learned that no packets are routed from A to C via B, but to D via B, then it will not forward the packet to C (unlike _RPF_), but only to D.

With SDN, it's granular. This means that engineers can selectively block malicious traffic throughout your network on a granular basis.  Traditional networking requires significant people power and technical expertise spread throughout your network. Each hardware component must be maintained, and connections must be monitored broadly. A SDN network allows all of these hardware components to be managed via a single touchpoint.  Drawbacks: One of the problems with virtualizing any infrastructure is the latency that arises as a result. The speed of the interaction with an appliance is dependent on how many virtualized resources are available.  One of the most significant security risk factors is the possibility of a compromised SDN controller attack at the control plane layer.

This can be a problem if for example a terminal has to be quiet so it doesn’t disturb the communication of a neighbor but it can’t get the communication request signal from the communication partner because it is hidden. This can be solved by using a busy signal or by listening to acknowledgments from the neighbor. NEAR AND FAR TERMINALS A signal from a station gets weaker with distance by the inverse square law.
