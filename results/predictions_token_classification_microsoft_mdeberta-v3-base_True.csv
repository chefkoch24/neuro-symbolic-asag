If the connections were also selected in such a way that the most favourable edge weights were used for building the tree (i.e. shortest path), the then so-called minimal spanning tree even represents the optimal connection of all other nodes.

In order that all IS know the multicast trees, the LINK STATE PACKAGES CAN BE EXTENDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MULTICAST GROUPS.

10.1_TC,"There are the differences between TCP and UDP headers: 1. TCP has a at least 20 bytes variable length header while UDP has an 8 bytes fixed length header. 2. TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms since it uses checksum but also provides flow control and acknowledgement of data while UDP has only basic error checking mechanisms using checksum. In TCP, Erroneous packets are retransmitted from the source to the destination. 3. TCP header contains the sequence number of data but UDP does not contain the sequence number. There is no sequencing of data in UDP. 4. TCP header has urgent pointer to show receiver where urgent data ends but UDP does not have this urgent pointer. 5. TCP contains information for not only compulsory but also optional functions while UDP has only the information for compulsory function. 6. UDP is comparatively faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP. However, TCP is reliable since it guarantees delivery of data to the destination. 7. TCP is heavy-weight, since TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection, before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control. However, UDP is lightweight. There is no ordering of messages, no tracking connections, etc. 8. UDP is connectionless, but TCP is connection-oriented.

8.2_MM,"The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to avoid duplicate sending of messages which results in a congested network and to save the effort that emerges when already received messages have to be stored in memory. In Reverse Path Forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. An accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. If packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies.

Since the distribution is memoryless and we've reached equilibrium, the probability that the system is in a certain state does not depend on the time. We have a finite queue, so there is a finite set of not-blocking states plus one blocking state.  As N=10, we need to calculate P[Blocking] = p_N = p_10 = ( (1-ρ)/ρ^10 ) / ( 1-ρ^(10+1) ) = 0.05081.

Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to ""ask itself"" two questions. First ""has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded. Otherwise it will ""ask itself"" the next question. ""Have the packets used the BEST route until now?"" If the answer is YES the node will send the packets onto an edge.

The state probability for all states with less than 10 waiting packets can be calculated as the following term: P(waiting packets less than 10) = p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 + p_9 = 0.9492.

1.6,"Differential Manchester encoding should be used because it is overall more complex.   Similarly to Manchester encoding, DM encoding takes advantage of splitting the interval into two, where a voltage level shift takes place (either from high voltage to low voltage or vice versa). However, Manchester encoding is still too similar to binary encoding in that a 1 will always be equivalent to a voltage shift from high --> low and a 0 will always be low --> high voltage. Instead, if the voltage shift occurs between intervals (either high -> low or low -> high), a 0 will be encoded. Likewise, if there is no voltage shift between intervals then a 1 is encoded. By comparing the current interval to the previous interval's voltage level, a more accurate encoding technique can be realized.  And unlike the binary encoding system, DM encoding does not rely on binary voltage levels to encode a bit stream. Instead, merely a change in voltage level between intervals encodes the bit stream. (Ex. A lack of voltage level change between the first and second interval would mean that the second bit in the stream is a 1) Therefore, because the voltages only need to differ between intervals, the bit stream is less susceptible to noise/error.","['Manchester encoding is still too similar to binary encoding in that a 1 will always be equivalent to a voltage shift from high --> low and a 0 will always be low --> high voltage', 'And unlike the binary encoding system']","['ly to Manchester encoding', 'encoding is still too similar to binary encoding in', 'be', 'to', 'voltage shift from high --> low and a 0 will always be low --> high voltage', 'And unlike the binary encoding system', 'encode']",INCORRECT

4.2_LM_v1.0,"Two solutions to the problem mentioned before are carrier extension and frame bursting. The basic principle in carrier extension is to attach a new extension field containing “scrap” data to the frame just to make it larger so that collisions can be detected. In Frame Bursting you take a similar approach, but instead of appending otherwise useless data, you just send a concatenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission. This is much more efficient than the carrier extension as no bandwidth is wasted on “scrap” data but the drawback is that the end-to-end delay for a frame is increased since you generally have to wait until you have the specified number of frames to send as a sequence which is bad for interactive services.",['you just send a concatenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission'],['you just send a concatenated sequence of multiple frames in a single transmission'],CORRECT
5.12,"One method to resolve the problem of duplicate packets is to use temporarily valid TSAPs for only one connection. On paper, this reduces the problem of duplicates since each TSAP is only used once and therefore reduces the number of duplicates to the ones occuring in that one connection. However, a disadvantage is that some TSAPs always exist and are well-known. Hence, it is not possible to realize this approach and generate temporary TSAPs for each connection.   Another method would be to make connections unique and identify them individually. An advantage is that duplicates from different connections do not occur anymore since each is unique. However, this is not possible with connection-less systems. Additional knowledge is needed to realize this approach since end systems need to remember the sequence numbers even after being turned off so that they remain unique for each connection.   The third approach to solve duplicates is to identify each packet individually with unique sequence numbers. An advantage is that it easily allows the receiver to identify and discard duplicate packets since it can just compare sequence numbers to check if it already received a packet with that number. However, this approach requires that the range of sequence numbers are chosen wisely so that they do not repeat before each packet is delivered and processed. Furthermore, this approach requires more bandwidth/memory due to the overhead of the sequence numbers.","['One method to resolve the problem of duplicate packets is to use temporarily valid TSAPs for only one connection', 'a disadvantage is that some TSAPs always exist and are well-known', 'Another method would be to make connections unique and identify them individually', '']","['One method to resolve the problem of duplicate packets is to use temporarily valid TSAPs for only one connection', 'a disadvantage is that some TSAPs always exist and are well-known', 'method', 'would be to make connections unique and identify them individually']",CORRECT

If not, the packet is discarded. Broadcast: If the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent, and if the packet used the best route until now, the edge is selected at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S, if not, the algorithm does not send over all edges, i.e., not as in Reverse path forwarding.

With a spanning tree the number of packets, especially the duplicates, can be minimized/limited. In multicast, this spanning tree can then also be reduced to the nodes belonging to the group.  To get such a spanning tree different protocols as for example Distance Vector or Link State routing can be used. For Link State routing, every node sends the information of all his neighbor nodes to everyone. With this information, the nodes can reconstruct the whole network and use e.g. Dijkstra Algorithm to get a spanning tree.

However, by calculating the blocking probability (the probability that the system is full) with the given formula, Pb = 0,0508 which is ca. 5%. So there is a 5% probability, that the system is full and 10 packets are waiting in the queue. For 1 minute (60 seconds) 5% are 3 seconds.

To adjust to changing topologies they utilize flooding to find suitable routes. The principle of the Reverse Path Forwarding is that each station has a spanning tree that represents the routing to other stations.

If so it is assumed that it used the best path until now and the packet is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded.  The Reverse Path Broadcast follows a similar approach. It differs in how it handles packets that are received on the entry port packets to this destination are usually assumed at. There is an additional check, if the packet used the best route until now. If so the edge is selected at which unicast packets arrive and from which they are then rerouted to the source.

The collision problem can be solved with Request-to-Send (RTS) and Clear-To-Send (CTS) mechanism. When node A wants to send something to node B, node A first asks whether the communication channel is available through RTS. If everything is ok, B sends a CTS message to A and C.

IP addresses are only assigned by DHCP for a limited time, so that after log-out of the device, the IP address attached to it before can be reused.",['it helps with the automatic or manual assignment of an IP address'],['it helps with the automatic or manual assignment of an IP address'],CORRECT
11.3_SDN,"One mode is replication and the other one is partitioning. A downside for replication is, that the second (replicated) controller has to be available the whole time and therefore kind of wastes resources as long as it is on standby. Also in very large networks the usage of bandwidth to keep the second server up to date could be higher. A downside for partitioning is, that a failure in one of the parts leads to problems in the corresponding part of the network because routing updates are no longer computed and distributed by that failed controller.","['replication', 'that the second (replicated) controller has to be available the whole time and therefore kind of wastes resources as long as it is on standby', 'A downside for partitioning is']","['One mode is replication and the other one is partitioning', 'A downside for replication is']",CORRECT

8.3_MM,"The purpose of both is to forward broadcast packets without forward loops. - Spanning Trees are loop free, so recieving duplicate packages is impossible - In case of having a single spanning tree for the whole network, one node has to be chosen by some alogirthm or manually to be the root node. After this the root node can announce itself through the link state packages as the root of the tree.

12.3_PE,"No this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic. Real Internet Traffic has built in congestion and flow control mechanisms, therefore if the packets get dropped due to queue buffer overflow from high arrival rate, there would be missing ACK messages detected at the sender side. Therefore the rate of transmission from sender will drop or slow down to compensate for slow receiver. In this sense the arrivals at each time interval are not really independent.",['No this assumption does not hold for real internet traffic'],"['Internet', 'Traffic']",PARTIAL_CORRECT
