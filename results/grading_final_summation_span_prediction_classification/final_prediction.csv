8.2_MM,"Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network. The idea of both algorithms is the use of so called “spanning trees” for each individual node in the network, which contain routes to every subnode in every subnetwork. Since one intermediary system does only know his own spanning tree, but not the ones of the surrounding nodes, each router has to use its knowledge of optimal routing for certain destinations as a criterion for further transmission. For Reverse Path Forwarding this means, that each node has to check the link on which an incoming packet is received. If this link is the optimal one, over which packets for this station are also usually sent, then node can assume that the packet has taken an optimal way up to it. As a consequence, it then re-sends the packet over all of its edges, but not the one on which the packet was received. If the packet on the other hand does not come over such an “optimal” link it gets discarded.  Since re-sending over all edges seems not to be the most efficient way of multicast-routing, Reverse Path Broadcast introduces a further check for packets that arrive over the optimal link as well as a limited re-transmission of packets: If a packet has taken the optimal path until this station, the station reroutes the packet over the optimal incoming link to the Source in reversed direction. This means, that the receiving node looks up in its routing table over which link such a packet would normally be received. Exactly this link is then used for rerouting the packet to the source instead of using all links as it is done before in Reverse Path Forwarding. Otherwise (so to say if the packet is not received on an optimal link or received on an optimal link, but has not taken an optimal path so far), the packet is not resent. This mechanism is implemented to limit the number of duplicates in the network - while Reverse Path Forwarding retransmits over all edges (excluding the one on which the packet was received), Reverse Path Broadcasting chooses the most suitable link for retransmission.",CORRECT,1.0,"[0.6167476773262024, 0.6326139569282532, 0.6456853151321411]","[(0, 64), (0, 64), (0, 64)]","[['Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network', 'Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network', 'Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcasting are both algorithms used for loop-free multi- and broadcast communication and therefore aim to be more efficient than simple attempts like flooding or individual sending of packets to every destination in the network']]",INCORRECT

Hidden Terminal can occur, when the nodes are quite far apart, while some nodes are not able to detect nodes anymore, while more centered nodes are able to detect messages from both the distant nodes. Then the distant nodes are not able to detect collisions occuring in the „middle“ of the network at the centered nodes, because the signal is not transmitted over all network nodes. One of the security issues can be, that wifi is set up inside of a building. A normal ethernet network over cable would connect all the nodes inside, and then can be configured to discard all the internal packages at the outgoing router to the internet.
