  <questionText>In an SDN, switches maintain a pipeline of flow tables and a meter table. Summarize their respective functions in one sentence each. </questionText>

    <referenceAnswer id="11.4_SDN.a1">Meter table: collects flow statistics or contains meter entry per flow (0.25) which is taken into account by the controller for management of the network like QoS operation(rate-limiting being one of them).
Flow pipeline: consists of flow tables that contain “rules” or fields (0.25) for packet forwarding(0.25) /actions to be taken on the packets or in other words it implements the
routing logic in the switch</referenceAnswer>

      <studentAnswer id="11.4_SDN.425">
      <response>Flow tables consists of flow entries. Incoming packets can be matched to these entries. Once a packet is matched to a flow entry, it is modified according to the instructions defined by the flow entry. So in general, flow tables control the processing of a packet before the forwarding process.
According to the official OpenFlow documentations, meter tables consists of meter entries, defining per-flow meter entries. Meter entries are used to measure and control the rate of packets of specified flows. Meter tables act as sort of traffic control.</response>

      <response>-A pipeline of flow tables
An OpenFlow switch matches packets with one or more flow tables.
A flow table contains flow entries, and packets are matched (by the OpenFlow switch) based
on the matching precedence of flow entries.
The OpenFlow pipeline processing defines how packets interact with flow tables contained by a switch.

-Meter table
Meters complement the queue framework and monitor the ingress rate of traffic as defined by a flow.
OpenFlow defines an abstraction called a meter table, which simply contains
rows of meters. These meters can be manipulated in a similar manner to flows.
Meters can receive packets and also (optionally) send packets.</response>

      <response>The flow tables consist of a list of flow entries (Match Field, Priority, Counters, Instructions, Timeouts, Table-Miss Flow) so whenever a packet arrives at one of these flow tables, it will be matched to an entry and the flow table then knows what to do with this packet to ensure fast and dynamic routing.

      <response>The flow tables consist of a list of flow entries which basically are some kind of rules which decide what to do with a packet once it arrives, like forward the packet to the next flow table or to a specific outgoing port. Therefore they have a match field (to check if a packet matches that entry), a priority (if multiple entries match), a counter, the instructions, timeouts and a table-miss flow entry.
The meter table is about statistics and allows sending packets to a given meter, for example to limit the packet rate.</response>
