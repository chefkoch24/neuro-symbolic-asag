  <questionText>Name the two modes of control plane distribution and name one downside for each of them. </questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="11.3_SDN.a1">Two modes of physical distribution of control plane and associated drawbacks are:
Replication
● Issue of scalability
● More resources, more cost
● Wastage of resources as the replicated node is on standby and no actual load
distribution occurs.
● The problem to keep the data consistent in the replicated node is hard and complex.
Partitioning
● Raises issues similar to P2P networks
● Knowledge about neighborhood
● Coordination and consistency
● Lower availability</referenceAnswer>

      <studentAnswer id="11.3_SDN.379">
      <response>There is Replication and Partitioning.

Replication: Replicate the Control Plane on a second machine, which is only
active if the first one fails. The downside is that there are costs for the
additional hardware and running the second machine on standby, without using
them most of the time.

Partitioning: Split the Control Plane on two machines and communicate
between them for coordination. The downside is the overhead from the
communication between the two machines to coordinate and maintain
consistency.</response>

      <response>1. replication
downside: scalability problem → missing load distribution

[Personal note: There are several methods of replication (all equal, single master/slave, multi master/slave, ...), each with its own downsides, so I concentrated on master/slave as the slide 27 did, then the bottleneck with respect to control network load seems to me the more important concern with this setup than consistency coordination.]

2. partitioning
downside: no redundancy / availability problem → single point of failure

[Personal note: Coordination of consistency is - in my opinion - a valid downside for both modes, but as the slide 28 suggests that there is no controller backup, availability seems to me the more important concern with this setup than consistency coordination.]</response>

      <response>Replication and Partitioning

Downside:
Replication may create state inconsistences and generate additional delay in case the primary controller fails. At the same time, the size and dynamics of the network will influence the scalability.
In Partitioning, there will be some issues that also in P2P networks raises. Furthermore, partitioning will be difficult to coordinate and consistent and forwarding delay between the controllers may happen.</response>

      <response>In the class we learned about two control plane distributions, the first one being replication and the second partitioning. The first relays on the dealing with failures, if the primary server fails, the secondary, also called slave, will take over. A downside of this is that the secondary is just there for back up, it won't “help” the primary as a peer in order to support large-scale deployment.

Then the partitioning is quite the opposite. We have two different servers with their own partitions, they are peers (coordinated and consistent) and have knowledge about their neighborhood. The downside of it, is that if one of the servers fails, it doesn't have a backup like in the first case.</response>

      <response>There are two different modes of control plane distribution:
- In replication, you have two exact identical systems running the control plane (master and slave), in which only one of the systems is active all the time. This means a higher amount of work for the operating system as well as decreased efficiency due to the redundancy of the systems.
- In partitioning, you have several systems running the control plane at the same time by splitting up the work for different parts of the network between the cooperating systems. A major downside of this system is, that the systems have to spend work on coordination and keeping up the consistency of their states.</response>

      <response>The two modes are (along with one downside each):

Replication:
The secondary SDN controller is only used once the primary one fails, before that it's idling and not being used at all. This introduces redundancy, which reduces the maximum possible network performance. It also adds cost to the network.

Partitioning:
There are networking issues similar to a peer-to-peer network (routing, reliability). If one of the SDN controllers should fail, part of the network won't be managed/controlled anymore and will most likely stop working, so the reliability is relatively low.</response>

The primary controller controls the entire network. If it fails, the second controller that was on standby the whole time, jumps in and takes over the job of the primary controller. The disadvantage of this distribution is that you’re wasting resources most of the time, when the primary controller is working.

      <response>The two modes of control plane distribution are called replication and partitioning.

When partitions occur, network architectures with separate control and forwarding planes can suffer more severe compromise of functionality than traditional architectures. The consequences of the loss of communication between a forwarding device and its controller include becoming unable to receive instructions for newly arriving flows and being unaware of updates in the routing rules for instance, due to changes in access control policies.

      <response>Control plane distribution can be achieved through replication and through partitioning.
A downside of replicated model is that all controllers, master and slaves need to store the same information, so that when the master fails, a slave is ready take in.
Partitioning requires for the controllers to coordinate between each other, so that there's consistency in the network.</response>

      <response>One mode is replication and the other one is partitioning.
A downside for replication is, that the second (replicated) controller has to be available the whole time and therefore kind of wastes resources as long as it is on standby. Also in very large networks the usage of bandwidth to keep the second server up to date could be higher.
A downside for partitioning is, that a failure in one of the parts leads to problems in the corresponding part of the network because routing updates are no longer computed and distributed by that failed controller.</response>

      <response>1.	Replication:
This mode is using two different control plane instances, a primary one (= „master“) and a secondary one (= „slave“) which is on standby. In case of the Master‘s failure and only in that case, the Slave will take over.
So one of the main downsides is the resource-wasting of the secondary control plane instance because it is mostly running on standby.

2.	Partitioning:
In this mode the control plane is split in two parts. Both of them are working together and coordinating their actions. So in case of failure of one of these two control plane instances, there will be problems.
That’s why one of the downsides of this network is the low robustness.</response>

      <response>There is Proactive and Reactive Routing.
Disadvantage of the proactive routing is that it occupies space in the flow table even when there is no traffic over that proactive defined route.  This is bad because there is only a limited size for the table.
Disadvantage of the reactive routing is that there is an delay at the first package because the rout needs to be established. Problem with connection-less protocol can send at full speed instantly without warning.</response>

      <response>Replication with a hot standby may have consistency issues due to synchronization between both API nodes/clusters.

Partitioning doesn't has consistency issues, but suffers availability problems, since not every node/cluster has all data available. This leads to higher latency for API calls.</response>

The disadvantage of Replication are the operating costs. You will have to operate two complex controller (Master and Slave) where only one at a time (primary) controls the network, the other one (secondary) being on standby waiting for the first to fail.
With Partitioning the downside is, that if one Controller breaks part of the network goes down with it. Only the part connected and controlled by the other Controller is able to run.</response>

      <response>Replication : In case of this mode, if the master fails then the control can be taken over by a secondary.
The downside is over-provisioning as we need to make sure the secondary is always available and that can be connected to when the master fails by replicating the master controls.

Partitioning : In this mode the load is divided by two separate controllers.

      <response>The first mode is Replication. Here, a master/slave architecture is used where one server in the network is the master and the switches act as its slaves. It comes with the drawback that this server might be a single point of failure. However, a secondary master can be used in the network but this can require some overhead in order to be started up.
The second mode is Partition. Here, several servers in the network divide their payload of switches they are responsible for. It comes with the drawback that there needs to be additional coordination by these servers in order to make the network reliable.</response>
