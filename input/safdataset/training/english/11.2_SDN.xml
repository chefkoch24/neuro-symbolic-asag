  <questionText>What are the benefits and drawbacks of SDN compared to traditional networking,where each switch/router has to manage forwarding and routing on its own? Describe two benefits and two drawbacks in 1-2 sentences each. </questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="11.2_SDN.a1">Benefits:
● Reduced complexity of the switches: They only have to act according to their flow
tables and do not have to make any local routing decisions.
● Due to centralized routing, the routing can converge way faster to a global optimum
than with decentralized routing because of a global view
● Better Integration of application and network provides a better global view of the
system.
● Increased flexibility :
1. We can update the routing logic on the fly, routers/switches are not limited
to hard-coded routing algorithms anymore (Note: this is also possible with
programmable switches).
2. API to “program” the network: Software (application) “defines” the
network
3. High-level programming languages for implementation of logic and making
use of powerful integrated development environments.
Note: In case the reasoning/example sufficiently explains the benefit, naming like reduced
complexity, increased flexibility can be omitted and response can still be granted 0.25 for
each benefit.

Drawbacks:
● High complexity of the control servers: They have to make all the routing decisions
for the (sub)network and can therefore be a bottleneck.
● Centralized routing in distributed systems in general: The routing completely depends
on the control server(s). To achieve better availability and fault tolerance, the number
of control servers can be increased. However, this can lead to synchronization and
consistency issues. → CAP problem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
● New technology adoption challenges:
● Switching to SDN from traditional networking.
● Training personnel on SDN.
All these will cost depending on the reconfiguration level but then for the long term, it
depends upon the ROI.
● Security-related concerns :
○ Lack of hardware security: eliminating the use of the physical routers and
switches, one also loses the security that comes with it.</referenceAnswer>

      <response>Benefits: 1. By separating control logic from the actual package forwarding, we can simplify switches and at the same time keep the forwarding performance of hardware-based forwarding in switches. 2. But not only is the switch simpler, this change of architecture also allows us to change the control logic later on, without having to replace or modify the many devices that previously each had their own logic. Instead we only have to change the single controlling software, making it far more versatile in the long run.

Disadvantages: 1. If we decide to use centralised controlling, the implementation of the controller is very hard. 2. However, if we choose to use distributed controlling, we run into the well known CAP problem, which states that it is impossible to guarantee the three properties “Consistency”, “Availability” and “Partition Tolerance” in any distributed system simultaneously.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response does not explain why a centralized controller would make the implementation harder than distributed controllers. Additionally, the response should distinguish between logical centralization and physical distribution.</response_feedback>

      <response>SDN allows the user to have more flexibility in comparison to traditional networking techniques by allowing them to define their own protocols adapted to their applications. Furthermore, there is a reduction in the complexity of the hardware due to the separation of the control logic from the data plane. This means that the control logic is migrated from the switches to the servers, which leads to a reduction in the cost of the switches.

One drawback of SDN is that the employees need to be schooled to be able to perform SDN and that they need new management tools to be able to do so.
Another problem is the security aspect as everything is handled by the controller and hardware security is missing.</response>

      <response>Separating the data plane and control plane gives the IT department an aerial-like view of the entire network, so this makes changes much easier, for example the changes can increase the speed of the entire network and one more benefit is companies have better security, for example the people with access to the controller can clarify secure routes in the system without a firewall to block any invalid routes but security is also a drawback because “all eggs are in one basket”- in the SDN Controller Layer, so if this is compromised the whole Network (Datacenter ect.) can be controlled by a miscreant.
The vulnerability of the controller is a problem because the controller is the way that the IT-Department will manage the network, so that means the controller must be completely secure and software plays a major role in SDN and software has bugs especially new software.</response>

      <response>The control plane is a central point for decision making for the whole network. Physically it can be distributed on multiple machines. It is separated from the data plane to simplify the decision making processes. It has a global view of the network which improves performance of the control plane.
The data plane is distributed on different devices in the network. Its main purpose is the forwarding of the packets. It only has a small view compared to the control plane. Is often implemented by using Routers/Switches and performance can be increased by utilising hardware for the forwarding (e.g. managed switch).</response>

    <studentAnswer id="11.2_SDN.281">
      <response>Benefits:
[1] Traditional network infrastructure has limited flexibility. SDN controller helps and assists with easy modification of the network control logic - From “hard-coded” logic to exchangeable software. This would enable to program the network at a higher level - “Think of it as a general language or an instruction set that let’s me write a control program for the network rather than having to rewrite all of code on each individual router,” - Scott Shenker
[2] It helps to reduce switching complexity by removing control logic from switch and host it on servers, and this happens while preserving same forwarding performance.

Drawbacks:
[1] Since functionalities of Routers and Switches are provided through Controller, Controller can be vulnerable to security attacks, therefore added extra security features can be an overhead.
[2] SDN is basically not required for small scale networks which have static routes configuration where changes in routes is actually not a requirement. For these kinds of static networks implementation of SDN can be a burden.</response>
      <response_feedback>SDN's stated drawback for small-scale networks is not a disadvantage, more of a case exempt from the benefits. Instead, the response should elaborate on why SDN implementation can be cumbersome.</response_feedback>

      <response>One benefit of SDN is, that it reduces the switch complexity which means that the switches still have the same forwarding performance but the control logic is removed and host on servers instead.
Another benefit is, that SDN allows easy modifications of the network control logic. So by removing the "hard-coded" control logic from the switches this allows to modify it and get exchangeable software instead which can be adapted to the specific needs of the network.
A drawback is the CAP problem which means, that for a distributed SDN controller only two out of three CAP properties (Consistency, Availability, Partitioning tolerance) are possible.
A second drawback is, that the logically centralization makes the implementation of the control logic simpler but the implementation of the actual controller harder, because all the logic is delegated to the controller which has to become very smart to provide a consistent view of a logically centralized network. If it's distributed the controllers have to communicate with each other, have to agree on a global view so some of the overhead is delegated to the controller.</response>

      <response>Benefits:
- The complexity of the switches is reduced, they don't need to support a variety of protocols, they simply use the forwarding tables calculated by the SDN controller.
- The knowledge of the topology of the whole network leads to better route selection, and therefore enables a bigger focus on QoS and QoE.

Drawbacks:
- The controller is a single point of failure, unless you use control plane distribution.
- The controller logic is very complex, because SDN moves the complexity from the switches to the controller. Due to this complexity, specialists are required for the controller development and administration.</response>

      <response>It is easier to maintain the networks, due to outsourced services that are administration the different network tasks.
SND provides redundancy, which makes the network more reliable (Controle Plane Distribution Replication)

With the new components of the network controller, there is another component, that has to be secured.
In order to implement SDN in an existing network, the whole network has to be redesigned.</response>
      <response_feedback>The first advantage is incorrect because it is unclear how the outsourced services offer easy maintenance. Additionally, redundancy is also possible in traditional networks, so it is not advantageous.

    <studentAnswer id="11.2_SDN.275">
      <response>Traditional networking is way faster (SDNs are slower) since the (full) featureset of a switch can be fully offloaded to specialized hardware.
On the other hand, SDN is more flexible. While the hardware can't be changed remotely SDNs can implement new features quite easily through the open API.

SDNs are also less complex since they are programmed with open APIs in high-level programming languages. Frameworks can offer very high level interfaces to allow less skilled people to maintain the network.
This leads to a more complex overall network, since not only the switch, but also the API service has to be hosted highly available to avoid any outages.</response>

      <response>Benefits:
- network logic can be easily exchanged/updated
  Because the logic is not hardcoded, it can be easily updated to newer versions that support new features or solve problems. Updating is easier and cheaper than replacing the hardware.
- high level programming languages
  Benefit from powerful development environments and therefore deploy new updates much faster (and probably with more features).

Drawbacks:
- vendor lock
  When deploying a SDN, the choice of vendor/manufacturer will have long-term effects on the available network components, because often hardware/software from different vendors can't properly communicate with each other and therefore can't be used inside the same network.
- more expensive
  Because of the processing power and generalization needed, the hardware is more complex and therefore more expensive. The cost of software development and support also increases cost. There is also less offerings/demand on the market.</response>
      <response_feedback>The first drawback regarding vendor lock is more prevalent in traditional networking compared to SDN. So it cannot be accepted as a disadvantage over traditional networks.  Apart from that, the response is correct.</response_feedback>

      <response>Benefits:
Firstly, SDN provides a centralized view of the entire network that helps to centralize enterprise management and provisioning.
Secondly, SDN can reduce overall operating costs and result in administrative savings since many of the routine network administration issues can be centralized and automated.
Thirdly, SDN unifies the cloud resources since networking components that make up massive data center platforms can all be managed from the SDN controller.
Fourthly, SDN can help to simplify implementation of control logic which gives consistent global view onto network

Drawbacks:
Firstly, SDN centralize security control into one point that can be easily attacked. Therefore, these controllers will be vulnerable.
Secondly, SDN will have synching of data or data authenticity problem with distributed controller.
Thirdly, SDN provides sometime controller redundancy.

      <response>A benefit of SDN is that the complexity of switches is reduced as the control logic is hosted in the control plane while switches still support forwarding in hardware which ensures the same performance as in traditional networks.
Another benefit is that the usage of high-level programming languages is possible in SDN, where traditional networking controllers/devices mostly have different and often low level programming languages through the presence of many different manufacturers.

A drawback of SDN is that the logical centralization of the controller complicates its implementation as the controller ideally should support all CAP properties, i.e. consistency, availability, and partitioning tolerance.

Another drawback is the security. If the centralized control plane is compromised the whole network can be controlled by a miscreant.</response>

      <response>Benefits:
One benefit of SDN over traditional networking is, that as the logic is no more "hard-coded" in the routing process of each switch but an exchangeable software the network control logic can easily be modified without having to access physical routers.
Another benefit of SDN is, that as the control logic is hosted on an external, logically centralized server, routers do not have to have a routing process and their complexity can therefore be reduced while maintaining the performance of forwarding in hardware.

Drawbacks:
Firstly, a controller with both a Northbound Interface to the control logic as well as a southbound interface to the data plane has to be implemented which is hard, as a lot of the overhead has been shifted to the controller.
Secondly, as the control logic is no longer in every router, if a controller in the control plane fails or breaks down, all routers which draw their information from that controller are not longer usable until the controller has been fixed or another controller takes over. Furthermore, information loss during the downtime can be a big factor.</response>

      <response>SDN makes routing much faster, by separating the control and the data plane, so that all the logical computing takes place in the control plane and the data plane is responsible only for forwarding packets.
In traditional networking, each switch must maintain its own routing table and compute the path forward, this slows down packet forwarding.
SDN maintains logical centralization and physical distribution, the logical centralization helps to maintain a consistent global view of the network, the physical distribution ensures that if one component of the system fails, other components can jump in and take over without the system being affected, ie, high availability, and scalability.

      <response>Two of the main benefits of SDN are the following ones:
- First of all, the network control logic can be easily changed and updated, since the administrator does not has to change the logic in all hardcoded (sic!) switches (like in classic networks), but only the software of the control units in the control plane. This plane then communicates the new rules to all switches.
- As it can be concluded from the answer before, the switches at all get less complex and therefore cheaper, since they don’t have to include a complex control logic anymore. They get the entries of their forwarding tables by the control plane and don’t have to figure them out by themselves.

Of course, there are also disadvantages of Software Defined Networking:
- Security protection is a major concern in SDN since the complete control logic of the network is centralized in the control plane. So the systems running the control plane gets an interesting target for attacks in order to take over control in the network.
- In order to establish SDN, the existing network needs to be completely reconfigurated - new control units for the control plane and improved switches that can receive control configurations by the control plane. This requires a high investment in the network to get the SDN running.</response>

1. the controller is vulnerable to attacks, which can affect all the switches
2. SDN is new technology which means more unstable

Benefits of traditional networking:
1. more secure because of the hard-coded nature from the manufacturer
2. more stable because of it is an older and mature technology.

Drawbacks of traditional networking:
1. Limited flexibility. For example in adding new hardwares.
2. increasing the switch or router complexity</response>
      <response_feedback>The response is partially correct because the stated advantages don't explain how these points are beneficial in comparison to traditional networking. The drawback of security doesn't describe what kind of attacks the SDN controller is vulnerable to.</response_feedback>

      <response>Benefits:
Switches and routers can easily be configured remotely from a logically central server.
The operator can adapt to newer routing algorithms or types of filters more easily simply by updating the software.
Drawback
If the central control server goes down, it means that the entire network can no longer adapt to changes.  To solve this you have to make sure your central server has high availability, which might be quite challenging.
The remote control plane might introduce new attack vectors against the system, allowing the attacker to insert sophisticated rules such as packet editing/packet injection.</response>
      <response_feedback>The first benefit does not answer what benefit is derived by transferring the control to the server. Apart from that, the response is correct.</response_feedback>

      <response>One benefit of the SDN is the possibility to modify the network control logic easily, because the control logic is no longer “hard-coded” in the switches . Another benefit is the reduced complexity of the switches with the same forwarding performance.
A drawback is that the controller is vulnerable and must be complete secure. Another drawback is if SDN is a new technology you need to change your whole system to implement it.</response>
      <response_feedback>The stated drawback of controller security is partially correct because it does not specify the SDN controller's vulnerabilities. Additionally, hybrid networks are possible so that one is not required to replace the entire network.</response_feedback>

      <response>One benefit of an SDN is the easy modification of the network control logic because the logic is not hardcoded anymore. Another benefit is the reduced switch complexity because the control logic is removed from the switch and hosted on the servers. A drawback is a significant amount of energy consumption and the limited memory size in switches.</response>
      <response_feedback>The stated drawback of energy consumption is not a disadvantage as traditional networking hardware also consumes energy. Apart from that, the response is correct.</response_feedback>
