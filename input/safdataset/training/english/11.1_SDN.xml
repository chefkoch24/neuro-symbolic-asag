  <questionText>Software-defined Networking (SDN) introduces separate control and data planes to manage network flows. Please explain the responsibilities of each plane in 1-2 sentences. Further, name two tasks the SDN controller takes care of. </questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="11.1_SDN.a1">Control Plane: The control plane is logically centralized, but can be physically distributed
(multiple coordinating control servers for higher availability and scalability).
One of the following responsibilities  should be given:
● decides the route for the packet/data
○ Control servers manage the network graph, define routes, and update the
flow tables of connected switches.
● handles unprocessed packets coming in from the data plane
Data plane: Responsible for packet forwarding. Individual switches just execute
actions according to their flow tables decided upon by the control plane.

The following are the tasks taken care of by the controller:
● Configuration of forwarding tables
● Injecting packets
● Events from switch (packet-in)
● Collection/Monitoring of traffic statistics
● Discovery of topology
● Inventorying what devices are within the network and the capabilities of each device
● Interfaces with control logic (control “application”) via the northbound interface(s)
● Implements a southbound interface to interact with the data plane.
● Implements the control plane.</referenceAnswer>

      <response>The two main components in the SDN are the Control Plane and the Data Plane. The Data Plane includes the various hardware network elements that are responsible for the actual routing of the packets according to the specifications of the Control Plane. Control Plane is responsible for the defining of routes and managing network graphs. Data Plane is responsible for the forwarding of packets.

Two of the most important tasks to be controlled by the controller include
- routing the data packets through the network
- the management of all network components involved</response>
      <response_feedback>The stated SDN controller task of routing the data packets is incorrect because the actual forwarding through the network is performed by the data plane. Apart from that, the response is correct.</response_feedback>

These are software or hardware components of the router or switch related to routing/forwarding user data/traffic from one interface to another.

Control plane refers to all the functions and processes that determine which path to use.

      <response>The control plane is responsible for routing by configuring the switches accordingly. This can happen proactively, before any traffic occurs, or reactively, while the network is operated and building up the pipeline of flow tables on the fly.
The data plane is responsible for forwarding. Each switch uses its flow table pipeline for that and looks up where a packet has to be routed to, whereas any packet information that identifies a communication relation, typically combinations of the header fields of the data link, network and transport layer, is used.
One task of an SDN controller is interfacing with control logic via its northbound interface.
Furthermore, the SDN controller implements a southbound interface to the switches in order to configure forwarding tables for them, inject packets, detect events from switches like newly received packets, collect traffic statistics or discover the topology.</response>

      <response>Data plane: The data plane is responsible for forwarding a packet from one open flow switch to the next to get a packet from its sender- through the network - to its receiver. The data plane implements the logic the control plane predefines.

Control Plane: The control plane is often a physically distributed but logically centralized unit, that defines routing and manages the network graph. Its responsible for calculating the optimal routes through the system, converging the routing algorithms quickly in case of disturbances and providing the SDN controller with the correct flow table entries.

The controller has an interface to both the data plane as well as the control plane and acts as a connecting link between the two planes.
Exemplary tasks the controller has to take care of are: Configuration of forwarding tables, injecting packets into the data plane, dealing with packets a switch does not know how to handle or collecting traffic statistics.</response>
